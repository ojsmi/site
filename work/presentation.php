As the presentation of research into interactive and reactive installations this slideshow features a blob, behind the text and images ( converted to line-art ) of the slides, which reacts to the presenter's voice. This uses Processing, one of the technologies spoken about in the presentation, and further illustrates some of the principles discussed.

This presentation had to fit within a variation of the Pecha Kucha format of 10 slides and 20 seconds per slide. Built with javascript, the slides search Flickr for a set of tags relating to the presentation and pull in an image, as well as displaying the other tags associated with the image. When the 20 seconds available for that slide is up it advances and repeats automatically.

The presentation was to a group of students and was intended as an introduction to my work and to me. I wanted to use it to illustrate the importance of creating your own tools that could be more appropriate, or more interesting than pre-made options and to show some of the variety and difference possible with this.
