AQT_16 is included in the book <a href="http://writtenimages.net">'Written Images'</a>, a generative art book by Martin Fuchs and Peter Bichsel 
<br/><br/>
Rapidly brought into existence in response to a call for entries, the piece grabs a 15 second sample from an audio stream to draw a series of towers which are scaled and coloured according to pitch and volume. There is an interesting anomaly, never tracked down, which occasionally throws out a bright blue tower.
