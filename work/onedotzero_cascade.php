<span class="red">Cascade 2010</span><br/>
As part of the 2010 Cascade workshop we were asked to consider the ideas and ideals of Utopia. Placed in groups of graduates with diverse backgrounds we had 5 days to find a model of working and develop an idea to help us explore this.
<br/><br/>
<span class="red">Utopia</span><br/>
The initial problem was coming to some form of consensus over what constituted Utopia, as well as a diversity in creative backgrounds there was the disparity in ideals to overcome or deal with. We progressed by making a series of presentations about different ideas and possibilities we saw within the theme, gradually coming closer to some form<br/> of agreement.

<p class="text-three-column small-text last">
<span class="red">A space</span><br/>
We headed towards the creation of a free space for exploration, thought and collaboration. A space that could exist outside of other structures, self contained and powered by those who use it.
<br/><br/>
<span class="red">The Anti-Doom-Dome</span><br/>
A grand utopian vision, a high point to aim for, the anti-doom-dome would be a space in which people could share their ideals and thoughts, in which they could create and participate in multiple utopias. The dome would be powered by multiple bikes around its outside, those providing power would have to selflessly ride, so that those inside could partake in the experience, with the hope that this would provoke thoughtfulness and consideration on the way to utopia.
