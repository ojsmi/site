<span class="red">Installation.</span><br/>
A single cell appears on the screen, spawned randomly. It is used to the conditions of its birth, the ambient volume and temperature and will react accordingly, dividing to reproduce it passes aspects of its makeup to its offspring whose character is modulated by the changing environment the installation is situated in.
<br/><br/>
The visitor is offered the opportunity to affect the internal environment, to play with the cells via heat, light and sound and can in this way shape the development of the system.
<br/><br/>
When the generation has run its course the system resets, taking the position of the last cell as its seed and in this way provides a continuous story of the interactions and reactions of the internal system and external environment.

<span class="red">Documentation</span><br/>
The system created is evolutionary, gradually revealing changes over time, the process utilised for this project was the same. Small, iterative steps were taken with the code, branching and evaluating multiple times in order to understand the different changes that could be made to the system with small adjustments to the initial state. 
<br/><br/>
A book of observations and considerations accompanies the project and includes an outline of the future of the system as well as the conslusion of this particular phase.
